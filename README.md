 This is a port of the old Pally Power for WoW 1.12 to Classic 1.13.  It's based on version 1.066.

#### added features:

  * hunter pets (note: in Classic pets are not grouped together as a class, so greater blessings need to be cast on each one.)
  * non-greater blessings (left click for greaters, right click for non-greaters)

## Installation

Make sure the folder is named `PallyPower` in your `Interface\AddOns` folder. If you download the master branch from GitHub it will add `-master` to the folder name.
